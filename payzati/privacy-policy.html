Last Updated: August 9, 2025

Payzati (‚Äúwe,‚Äù ‚Äúour,‚Äù or ‚Äúthe App‚Äù) respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information when you use the Payzati mobile application.

1. Information Collection

By default: Payzati does not collect, store, or share any personal or sensitive user data from your device.

No account registration is required.

No financial or personal identifiers are collected by us.

All spending and transaction data (e.g., SMS imports or manual entries) remain on your device only and are never sent to us.


Advertising (default):
Payzati displays ads using third-party advertising networks. These networks may collect limited information such as:

Device identifiers (e.g., Advertising ID)

Approximate location (if enabled on your device)

Usage patterns (e.g., ad views, clicks)


This information is collected and processed by the advertising partners, not Payzati.

Premium / Ad-Free Upgrade:
If you purchase the premium version, ads are removed. In that case, no advertising data will be collected.

Optional Features (if enabled):

Google Backup or Cloud Sync: If you choose to back up or sync your data, information may be transferred securely to your chosen cloud provider (e.g., Google Drive). This process is controlled by the third party, not Payzati.

Analytics (future): If we enable analytics, anonymous data (e.g., crash reports, feature usage) may be collected to help improve the App.

2. How We Use Data

When ads or optional features are active, data may be used to:

Display relevant advertising.

Process in-app purchases (e.g., to remove ads).

Provide cloud backup and restore functionality.

Diagnose issues, improve stability, and enhance features.



---

3. Data Sharing

Payzati does not sell your personal data.

Advertising networks and optional third-party services (Google Backup, analytics) may process data under their own privacy policies.

Data may also be shared with legal authorities if required by law.



---

4. Children‚Äôs Privacy

Payzati is safe for general use. However, because ads are displayed by default, children may be exposed to advertising content. We do not knowingly collect any personal information from children.


---

5. Data Security

All financial data remains on your device. If you enable optional cloud features, your information will be subject to the security measures of those providers.


---

6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If significant changes occur (such as new third-party integrations), we will update the Policy and notify users within the App.
